title: Investigation of Hydrogen Blending into Natural Gas Systems
description: This project, was submitted to the ASME 2025 International Conference, investigates the effects of hydrogen blending into methane for industrial gas turbines. The study analyzes the thermodynamic impacts of varying hydrogen concentrations (10% to 90%) on Brayton cycle performance, focusing on increased power output, elevated temperatures, and the resulting engineering challenges. Advanced equations of state, such as Van der Waals, Soave-Redlich-Kwong, and Helmholtz free energy models, were employed to model real gas behaviors. The findings highlight the trade-offs between reducing carbon emissions and overcoming material, cooling, and control system limitations in turbine designs.
