description: Collaborated in a multidisciplinary team as part of the Society of Automotive Engineers at Cal State Long Beach. I was part of the Rear Suspension Team for the 2023-2024 Baja project. As part of the rear suspension team, my duties included working on bracket and mounts in order to integrate the rear suspension components into the main chasis and interface with the rest of the vehicle. My duties included: Utilizing solidworks in order to create the parts, running stress simulations in solidworks in order to validate theoretical stress and strain simulations, collaborate with other subsystems in order to create parts that fit with components outside my susbsystem, document my progress and make sure the parts were adequately stored within database. I also participated in workshops to learn welding, FEA, Ansys and Machine shop usage.
