description: "Collaborated in a multidisciplinary team as part of the Society of Automotive Engineers at Cal State Long Beach. I was part of the Rear Suspension Team for the 2023-2024 Baja project. As part of the rear suspension team, my duties included working on brackets and mounts in order to integrate the rear suspension components into the main chassis and interface with the rest of the vehicle. My duties included: Utilizing SolidWorks in order to create the parts, running stress simulations in SolidWorks to validate theoretical stress and strain simulations, collaborating with other subsystems to ensure compatibility, documenting my progress, and making sure the parts were adequately stored within the database. I also participated in workshops to learn welding, FEA, ANSYS, and machine shop usage. For this project, one of the main challenges was to interface parts that could not only withstand the needed loads to not fracture, but also be able to do it independently of other subsystems and in a way that is easy to manufacture. Since the chasis was not built at the time, one aspect of project was that we had to hypothsize and predict any movement done by the chasis that would affect the rear suspension parts. Additionally we had to do a thorough analysis on the distribution of the load. I worked along side other students and faculty advisors as well as team leads in order to analyze to the best of my ability the loads, location, and material to succesfully interface the parts"
