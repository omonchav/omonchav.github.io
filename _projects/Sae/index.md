description: "Collaborated in a multidisciplinary team as part of the Society of Automotive Engineers at Cal State Long Beach. I was part of the Rear Suspension Team for the 2023-2024 Baja project. As part of the rear suspension team, my duties included working on brackets and mounts in order to integrate the rear suspension components into the main chassis and interface with the rest of the vehicle. My duties included: Utilizing SolidWorks in order to create the parts, running stress simulations in SolidWorks to validate theoretical stress and strain simulations, collaborating with other subsystems to ensure compatibility, documenting my progress, and making sure the parts were adequately stored within the database. I also participated in workshops to learn welding, FEA, ANSYS, and machine shop usage."
