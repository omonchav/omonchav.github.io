In my role, I collaborated with team members and various subsystems to design, test, and manufacture a liquid propellant rocket. This involved leveraging tools such as Solidworks, LabVIEW, OpenRocket, and Rocket Propulsion Analysis (RPA) to simulate and execute engine and igniter tests. As the lead engineer for the propulsion team, I designed a spark torch igniter and developed C++ code to interface with an Arduino, enabling real-time control and data acquisition from thermocouples and pressure transducers during testing. To ensure precision in manufacturing, I referenced ASTM standards and conducted external research to evaluate corrosion rates in LR-101 engine samples. My responsibilities also included conducting high-risk operations, such as torch igniter firings, high-pressure pneumatic tests, and water flow tests, while adhering to strict safety protocols. Additionally, I standardized P&ID symbols for the club and trained members in creating industry-grade AutoCAD drawings. Finally, I participated in assembly, testing, and safety drills at the Friends of Amateur Rocketry (FAR) launch site to prepare for project deployments.
