title: 4 Bar Mechanism Kinematics of Dynamics project
description: This project involved designing, prototyping, and analyzing a functional four-bar linkage mechanism to simulate an oil pump. Using SolidWorks, a scaled prototype was modeled and 3D-printed using ABS material. Position, velocity, and acceleration analyses were conducted for the mechanism, comparing theoretical calculations with SolidWorks simulations. An Arduino Uno was programmed to control a servo motor, enabling real-time actuation of the linkage. The project demonstrated hands-on skills in CAD, motion analysis, and embedded system programming while highlighting the influence of friction, weight, and real-world factors on the performance of physical models. I was responsible for programming the servo motor to control the linkage movement, designing the four-bar linkage mechanism in SolidWorks according to specified dimensions, setting up motion studies for position, velocity, and acceleration analyses, and preparing the 3D printing files using PLA material. The project involved creating a scaled prototype of an oil pump mechanism, conducting theoretical calculations, and validating them through SolidWorks simulations and experimental testing. Although not implemented, there was a partial code developed to try and interface a measuring mechanism for automatic rpm detection rather than manual.
