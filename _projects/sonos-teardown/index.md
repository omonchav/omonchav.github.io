title: Telerobotic Hand 
description: As part of a six-student team for our Capstone project, I worked on developing a teleoperated robotic hand designed for precise remote manipulation in astrobiology and biosafety laboratories. My contributions focused on the programming, wiring, circuit design, and integration of sensors and actuators to ensure smooth communication between the user-controlled glove and the robotic hand. I developed and implemented Arduino-based firmware that processed real-time data from flex sensors, IMU sensors, and force-sensitive resistors, allowing the robotic hand to mirror human hand movements with precision. I designed and assembled the circuit architecture, ensuring proper signal flow between components, and optimized power distribution to provide a stable voltage supply to servo motors and microcontrollers. By calibrating IMU sensors for accurate motion tracking and integrating force-sensitive resistors to dynamically adjust grip strength, I helped refine the system's ability to perform delicate grasping tasks. My work also included debugging and optimizing the system's response time, reducing latency, and enhancing real-time motion replication. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience in embedded systems, electronics integration, and robotic control, demonstrating my ability to design and implement functional mechatronic systems.
