title: Heat Transfer Final Project 
description: The goal of this project was to analyze a 2D steady heat conduction in a rectangular domain with internal heat generation and radiation boundary conditions. To do so, we had to map the geometry, set up the finite element model, incorporate the nonlinear radiation boundary conditions, and solve for the temperature field. As part of a group of 5 students, I was tasked with developing the hand calculations for a simplified version of the larger scale model. I worked alongside 1 student to develop the finite element model using Python interfaced with MATLAB, incorporating nonlinear radiation boundary conditions, and solving for the temperature field. We utilized a GUI that was built with Tkinter by other students, for user inputs and visualized results through Matplotlib. The analysis included assumptions of steady-state heat transfer, uniform heat generation, and constant thermal conductivity. Applications of this work extend to satellite thermal control to maintain electronic components within operational temperature ranges.
